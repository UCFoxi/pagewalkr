# pagewalkr üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüêïüê©
An x64 page table iterator written in C++ as a kernel mode x64 Windows driver. The code in this repository is released under the MIT license. The project has been developed, debugged and tested on Windows 10 20h2. The usage of a kernel debugger and a virtual machine is highly advised. PRs are open, just like I am to criticism, feel free to open issues, discuss and suggest new features to implement.

This project usses structures provided by ia32.hpp, a project which turned the entirety of the intel manual (SDM) defined structures into a single header, by wbenny & tandasat. https://github.com/wbenny/ia32-doc

## Uses
This is just a proof of concept, it scans the kernel's paging tables to look for a single function prologue to demonstrate it could be used to scan for mapped executable payloads inside the kernel. It provides no real way to communicate to usermode the findings of the scan, nor does it store them in any way. Feel free to implement your own functions and logic inside the scan functions should you decide to use this project as a physical memory scanner; or something completely new. You could even use this as a scanner to aid in analysis when trying to find rootkits or anomalies of any kind in the page tables, as it would be a near-perfect executable memory scanner in the cr3 you execute it in, it's not extremely fast, it is, after all, scanning a ton of memory, so I don't suggest its usage in production software. You can switch the cr3 and run the algorithm nearly as-is to get the same effect in other cr3s (processes).

## Notes
MmMapIoSpace isn't used while MmGetVirtualForPhysical is used instead because of a patch put in by microsoft that makes it no longer possible to map the page tables with MmMapIoSpace as an exploit mitigation. You can't map page tables anymore by DESIGN, you can't therefore just patch away microsoft's "patch" to the function, as far as my understanding goes. However, it's not hard to replicate the inner workings of MmMapIoSpace. Replacing a page's PTE and using ``__invlpg`` on the page address you previously mapped this way should be more than enough to map an address. Of course, to be able to run this in your system, you'll need to have test signing enabled, otherwise you won't be able to run the driver without digitally signing it. To enable test mode, simply run ``bcdedit /set TESTSIGNING ON`` on an elevated command prompt and reboot the system. If you already possess a production kernel mode signing certificate, of course, you can skip this part and sign it with your own certificate.

## But how does this work?
Thorough documentation is not available at this time due to this being such a small project albeit treating such a complicated topic to explain in a few comments. Comments are certainly included in the page table iteration code to explain what's going on, but those comments are written for someone who has at least given a reading to the paging section of the Intel SDM, or already has a vague idea of what should be done to iterate over those pages, the 4 level page table hierarchy is not a system that should ideally be explained in a cpp project in a few comments. This project simply illustrates what needs done, and doesn't take care of paged out addresses.

## Example (Mapped memory scanner)
A small example is contained in the repository which simply runs the find_pattern function: a function that is meant to find the first occurrence of a certain byte pattern in memory. The scan will start at the "start" address and end at "start + size". The example scans for a common function prologue:

``48 89 5C 24 08    mov qword ptr [rsp+8], rbx``

once the first occurrence of the pattern is found, it will print its finding to the kernel debugger, and you'll be able to verify for yourself that the pattern is, indeed, there with ``uf <address>``.

This example only scans memory that is outside the regular module allocated memory in the kernel, and it can be used to track down mapped payloads inside the kernel. Ideally, you'd want find_pattern to scan for **all** occurences of the pattern outside module memory. I didn't implement such a feature because i found the performance to be severely degraded by it, and if a pattern appears even just once in a page, that means you can dump the entire page to disk and analyze it, no need to scan for all occurences of patterns since the scan works page by page (even large pages are split in 4k (0x1000) bytes "chunks" to scan).

## Verify the findings
I was looking through internet communities to see if someone actually figured out how to check if an address resides in module memory or not, and i stumbled upon this on OSR:

https://community.osr.com/discussion/55379/how-to-easily-determine-module-offset-into-for-a-given-address

The user (Administrator at the time of writing) ``Scott_Noone_`` posted a simple WinDbg command that, given an address, will print the module it resides in and its offset. I've edited the command so that it will tell us whether or not the address resides in module memory.

``!for_each_module j <insert address here> > @#Base & <insert address here> < @#End '.echo The address resides in module memory'``

## Getting started
- Install VS2019
- Install the WDK (Windows driver kit) + the WDK extension for VS2019
- Build as-is, release and debug mode in x64 should both be compiling out of the box.

## How to use
- Open a CMD prompt as admin, run "``sc create pagewalkr type= kernel binPath= "C:\path\to\the\file\you\just\built.sys"``".
- Open a CMD prompt as admin, run "``sc start pagewalkr``", and look at the kernel debugger to see the results.
